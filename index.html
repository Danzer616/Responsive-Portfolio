      <p>My name is Daniel Alexander. I am 28 years old and I am from Logan, Ut. In 2015, I graduated from Utah State University with bachelor degrees in history and philosophy as well minors in German and sociology. In my spare time, I enjoy playing shows in my metal bands, hiking, camping, firearms, reading, and exercising.</p>

      <p></p>

      <p>Having played in metal bands for ten years, I have been fortunate enough to tour North America and have shared the stage with many of my favorite underground bands across multiple metal genres. When I am reading, history books take up the majority of my time. I love reading about both World Wars, Ancient Greece and Rome, Pagan Europe, the industrial revolution, and other topics. When I am able to find free time for video games, I enjoy the Mass Effect series, System Shock 2, Resident Evil 2, and I am awaiting the up-and-coming Star Citizen sci-fi MMORPG.</p>
